# Count it!

### Task

#### [Count it!](./0-count.py)
- Write a recursive function that queries the [Reddit API](./https://intranet.hbtn.io/rltoken/PV_GanilbTliu3BSqFKPKA), parses the title of all hot articles, and prints a sorted count of given keywords (case-insensitive, delimited by spaces. Javascript should count as javascript, but java should not).
